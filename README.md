# advent-2024-clojure

This is my code for the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024),
all solutions in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

All code is under the `src` directory. Each solution-file is named `dayNN.clj`
and contains both puzzle solutions for that day. These are the
publically-facing functions `part-1` and `part-2`. These files are the code
*exactly as I used it to solve and submit the answers*. If I revisit any of the
days and try to clean up or optimize the solutions, that work will be in a
separate file that will be named `dayNNbis.clj`
(["bis"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bis)). I may go back and
comment code after the fact, when I'm not racing the clock.

## Stats

Number of answers correct on first submission: 30/32 (93.75%)

Highest finish for first half: 695

Highest finish for second half: 2907
